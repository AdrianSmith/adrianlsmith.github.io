Thanks Tomas - that is nice to hear. Personally, I woulkd find it difficult to work with Ivan.

My treatment is complete for now (4 weeks radiation therapy, 15 week chemotherapy and 2x surgeries and 11 weeks hospital recovery).

Now I am an outpatient for the remainder of my rehab and prosthetic fitting etc (my right leg was amputated above the knee).

I've been catching up on sleep and trying to arrange all the stuff I need to get approved to drive again and convert my car to a left-foot-accelerator.

Now that my brain is working again I've been learning about LLM and coding again which has been great fun and inspired me again.
